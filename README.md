# Rstudio_Update
- Basic notes on steps to update R within R studio.
- Installr is a better option because it facilitates updates and ensures an easy transition to the update.
- Unfortunately, I tweaked a function to install Rstudio and did not work.
- I will like to know how to get rstudio straight from their FTP servers but dont have time to work on it yet.
